  details: "The government of Bangladesh is actively pursuing strategies to diversify its export basket and reduce the country's heavy reliance on the readymade garments (RMG) sector. Efforts are being made to promote the export of other potential goods and services, including agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, and information technology. This diversification drive aims to enhance economic resilience and create new avenues for growth in the global market. Various policy initiatives and incentives are being considered to support the development and promotion of these non-traditional export sectors. The success of this diversification strategy is considered crucial for the long-term sustainable economic development of Bangladesh.",
